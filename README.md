# National Pokedex Database  
## Project Summary  
The main focus of the project will be describing video game characters called Pokémon through
their in-game statistics, types, moves, abilities, and evolution chains. Our database will differentiate between two categories of Pokémon, Wild Pokémon and Trainer Pokémon in which Wild Pokémon can be found in routes and regions, while Trainer Pokémon will be associated with Trainers and their collections. Trainers are video game characters that own collections of Pokémon and items that can be used on the Pokémon and both Pokémon and Trainers can be found in Routes and Regions in the world of Pokémon.
